# MineSync - An AI - Driven Sustainibility Platform for the Mining Industry

## Implementation:
Fully implemented on AWS. Deployed Frontend on Amplify.

Configured Backend using API Gateway and AWS Lambda.

Data stored in DynamoDB.

## Problem Statement:
The mining industry currently faces the problem of not following sustainable practices. Mining companies often go into rural areas where indigenous people live and pollute the area, giving rise to troubles towards the environment and locals. Our task was to promote sustainability by making a web interface that allows locals, mining companies, and regulators to all be able to communicate with each other and make sure sustainability protocols are being followed. Use AI to enhance this web interface.

## Solution:
We made a web interface where you can either login as a mining company, local, or regulator. If you are a local you can submit complaints against companies. If you are a company you can see complaints and be given a sentiment analysis score based on our sentiment score algorithm. If you are a regulator, you see a list of companies and their current standings. AI was used to make sentiment and sustainability towards companies based on the locals' comments and the companies' policies itself.
